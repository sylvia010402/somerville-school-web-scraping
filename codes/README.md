#Code Structure

The code is to srape the enrollment data from the [school website](https://profiles.doe.mass.edu/profiles/student.aspx?orgcode=02740075&orgtypecode=6&&fycode=2022), from year 2005 to 2024. It is written in a R-markdown file so that it divides each step of scrapping in a more structured way. To scrape the data needed, you can run the code chunks in order from step 1 to 5, where: 

-**Step 1**: Single Page Data Extraction 
-**Step 2**: Function Development and Testing 
-**Step 3**: Comprehensive Data Collection Planning and Execution
-**Step 4**: Data Integration and Standardization 
-**Step 5**: Data Visualization and Trend Analysis
